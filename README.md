👋 Hi there, I'm Tingfeng Lan, a PhD student at University of Virginia (UVA). Welcome to my GitHub pages!!!
 
🔍 I’m currently diving deep into research on machine learning/deep learning systems. I’m deeply obsessed with performance optimization — always looking for ways to push systems to their limits!

🔧 I’m currently building [DLRover](https://github.com/intelligent-machine-learning/dlrover), an automatic distributed deep learning system. If you are interested, welcome to join us!

🌐 You can find more about me on [my personal website](https://antlera.github.io/).

✉️ And if you want to contact me, please email my mailbox: erc8gx@virginia.edu.
